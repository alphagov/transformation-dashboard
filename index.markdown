headline-title: Digital Transformation

headline-subtitle: Government is building digital services that are simpler, clearer and faster to use. We’re starting with these 25 services. You can follow our progress on this page.

intro: |
    ### Digital services so good people prefer to use them

    The [Government Digital Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-digital-strategy-reports-and-research) and [departmental digital strategies](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-digital-strategy-reports-and-research#departmental-digital-strategies) commit us to the redesigning and rebuilding of 25 significant ‘exemplar’ services. We’re going to make them simpler, clearer and faster to use. All these are to meet the [Digital By Default Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) by April 2014 and be completed by March 2015.

    This dashboard shows you which transactions are in the programme, what progress is being made, and the estimated scale of the digital service.

    You can read more about the transformation programme on [our blog](https://digitaltransformation.blog.gov.uk/).
