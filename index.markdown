  ###Digital services so good people prefer to use them

  We’re redesigning and rebuilding 25 major government services to make them simpler, clearer and faster to use. This page lets you follow our progress. You can see which services are in the transformation programme, the scale of those services, and the stage of development they’re at.

  These services will meet the [Digital By Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) by April 2014, and reach public beta or go live by March 2015. 

  This work is being done by 8 government departments as part of the [Government Digital Strategy](/government/collections/government-digital-strategy-reports-and-research) and [departmental digital strategies](/government/collections/government-digital-strategy-reports-and-research#departmental-digital-strategies).

  You can read more about the transformation programme on the [transformation blog](https://digitaltransformation.blog.gov.uk/).
