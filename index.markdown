Government is building digital services that are simpler, clearer and faster to use. We started with the Transformation Programme to make 25 major services digital by default. Work on these 'exemplars' has reached its end. This page is about how we did.

## Useful links

Here is:

## What the Transformation Programme was

In January 2013, government gave itself 400 days to transform 25 major services, making them digital by default and simpler, clearer and faster to use. We called this the Transformation Programme.

With help from the Government Digital Service, 8 departments across government set about redesigning these digital exemplars based on the needs of users, not the needs of government.

We used this page to report progress on how development of each service was going.

In March 2015 the programme ended. [We've archived the old version of this page](/transformation/exemplars/) so you can still see where we were by the end of the programme.

## How the Transformation Programme went

By March 2015, government had delivered a range of world-class digital services used by millions of people, both in the UK and abroad.

Twenty exemplar services were publicly available. The remaining 5 are still in development and Home Office, DWP, HMRC and BIS/Land Registry will continue work to deliver them, building [digital by default](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) services that meet the needs of their users.

## What's next for digital transformation in government
Digital transformation doesn’t end here. Government continues to develop skills in the departments and agencies improving these services, and building others to make sure they're so good that people prefer to use them.

From our work over the last 2 years, it was clear that this programme was just the beginning. It's vital that we take what we’ve learnt to support further transformation in government.

We’re working with departments to build on the momentum and experience gained during the Transformation Programme to help build world-class user-centred services.

You can follow how that work is going on [the GDS blog](https://gds.blog.gov.uk).
