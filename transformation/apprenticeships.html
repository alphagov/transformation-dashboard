  <h2>Successes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Passed alpha to beta <a href="/service-manual/digital-by-default">Digital by Default Service Standard</a> assessment</li>
    <li>The scope of the public beta of the candidate service has been defined</li>
    <li>Several permanent digital delivery team members have been appointed and are being introduced into the exemplar team</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Challenges</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The scope of the service to be delivered for candidates, employers and training providers is ambitious and not all service functionality will be delivered before programme end</li>
    <li>The public beta of the candidate service is dependent on changes to the legacy system API managed by a third party supplier</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Next</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Complete development of features for the public beta of the candidate service </li>
    <li>Test that changes to the legacy service work as intended</li>
    <li>Continue selection and appointment of permanent digital delivery team members</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
      All customer journeys across information and transactions will be integrated so individuals can find information tailored to their needs and search, view and apply for opportunities online in an engaging and inspiring way. Employers will be able to quickly and easily self-serve to engage with apprenticeships and advertise vacancies and identify suitable candidates.
    </blockquote>

  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>To create an easy to use digital service where apprenticeships can be advertised and applied for, with the transaction supported by clear information to inform and advise users, so that they can self-serve, leading to minimal additional support being required.</p>

  <h2>Digital inclusion</h2>

  <p>GDS has mapped the exemplars against the <a href="/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion">digital inclusion scale</a> to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. <a href="/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#apprenticeship-applications">See the rating for Apprenticeship applications</a>.</p>
