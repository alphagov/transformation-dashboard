    <p>The National Apprenticeship Service (NAS) funds and supports Apprenticeships throughout England. The existing digital service allows employers to advertise vacancies with potential apprentices searching and applying online. But user experience is poor (especially on search), so that the way applicants are matched to potential vacancies is sub-optimal and both applicants and employers are put off using it. Addressing this would bring real economic benefit. The National Audit Office reports that the current £0.5bn apprenticeship spend is more than worthwhile for boosting the economy. For each 1% by which better digital tools increase the value of the service, the NAO report implies we should expect well over £5m / year of economic boost, thus even on very conservative assumptions, the exemplar will easily have a positive ROI in terms of economic growth and tax revenues.  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Advertising or applying for apprenticeships is made quicker and easier online</li>
      <li>Better applicant experience: more integrated, simple and consistent</li>
      <li>Cut cost of digital service - TBC</li>
      <li>Economic growth: significant though unquantified </li>
