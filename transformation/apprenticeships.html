    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
      All customer journeys across information and transactions will be integrated so individuals can find information tailored to their needs and search, view and apply for opportunities online in an engaging and inspiring way. Employers will be able to quickly and easily self-serve to engage with apprenticeships and advertise vacancies and identify suitable candidates.
    </blockquote>

  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>The National Apprenticeship Service (NAS) funds and supports apprenticeships throughout England. The existing digital service allows employers to advertise vacancies with potential apprentices searching and applying online. But user experience is poor (especially on search), so that the way applicants are matched to potential vacancies is suboptimal and both applicants and employers are put off using it. Addressing this would bring real economic benefit. The National Audit Office (NAO) reports that the current £500 million apprenticeship spend is more than worthwhile for boosting the economy. For each 1% by which better digital tools increase the value of the service, the NAO report implies we should expect well over £5m per year of economic boost, thus even on very conservative assumptions, the exemplar will easily have a positive return on investment in terms of economic growth and tax revenues.</p>
