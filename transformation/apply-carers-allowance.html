    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
     The new service is being developed with the needs of carers at its heart, looking to remove complexity from the current user journey. There are clear benefits for people who are caring full-time of being able to interact with the Department at a time and in a way that suits them.
    </blockquote>

    <p>From the '<cite><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-digital-strategy">Department for Work &amp; Pensions digital strategy</a></cite>' – December 2012</p>

    <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>Carer’s Allowance is a benefit for people looking after someone with substantial caring needs. Users can currently make a claim through the post or online. The exemplar project will replace the existing online claim process which currently has low take-up and does not meet the standards set out in the Department’s digital strategy.</p>

    <p>The Carer’s Allowance project is currently progressing through Beta phase, with live screens already being tested with real users. The Minimum Viable Product will go live with some users in autumn 2013, after which we’ll continue iterating and improving the service. To learn more about the Carer’s Allowance work you can visit the <a href="https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/" rel="external">DWP Digital Blog</a> where we’ll be posting regular updates.</p>
