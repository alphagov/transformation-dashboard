    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
     The new service is being developed with the needs of carers at its heart, looking to remove complexity from the current user journey. There are clear benefits for people who are caring full-time of being able to interact with the Department at a time and in a way that suits them.
    </blockquote>

  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>Carer’s Allowance is a benefit for people looking after someone with substantial caring needs. Users can currently make a claim through the post or online. The exemplar project replaced the previous online claim process which had low take-up and did not meet the standards set out in the department’s digital strategy.</p>

  <p>The Carer’s Allowance project is currently in public beta and is regularly tested with real users. We will continue to improve the service with regular small releases. To learn more about the Carer’s Allowance work you can visit the <a href="https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/">DWP Digital Blog</a> where we’ll be posting regular updates.</p>
