    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>Allow citizens with chip passports from European Economic Area (EEA) plus registered travellers from other nations (US, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand) to come through digital e-Gates, avoiding manual border guard checks. e-Gates will be provided at more ports and airports and the scope of people allowed to use them will greatly increase.</p>
