      users will be able to make a claim, check details of payments, notify changes of circumstance and search for a job through a single account, making digital the primary channel for most working-age people to interact with the Department.

    <p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/universal-credit-roll-out-from-october-2013">Pathfinder service (a beta)</a> is being tested in 2 areas of the north-west, with another 2 starting later in July 2013. </p>

    <p>The Pathfinder exercise has shown that the IT system works underpinned by the Real Time Information system.</p>

    <p>But, in parallel, after asking major projects expert David Pitchford to review it earlier this year, ministers have accepted his recommendation that they should explore enhancing the IT for Universal Credit working with the Government Digital Service.</p>

    <p>Advancements in technology since the current system was developed have meant that a more responsive system that is more flexible and secure could potentially be built. This would marry with the best of the existing Pathfinder system.</p>
