  <div>
    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>The tax exemplars will provide digital PAYE services for people in employment (benefits in kind), a fully digital self assessment service, improved tools and tax dashboard for small businesses, and a new system for tax agents to use online services. These will be built on a new “digital tax platform” which will over time replace the current HMRC Portal and be the default platform for new customer-facing services. The new tax platform will be fully integrated with the pan-government ID Assurance programme and with GOV.UK.</p>
