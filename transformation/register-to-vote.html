    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

      <p>ERTP will transform the electoral registration process by introducing Individual Electoral Registration (IER).  Instead of one person in a household supplying the details of all people living at the same address (this can result in fraud and errors), IER will require people to register individually.</p>

      <p>To support IER and make it simpler for users, a new digital channel will be created and a method for confirming identities will be introduced.  IER is being delivered to rebuild trust in our electoral system and to modernise our system of registering to vote.</p>
