    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>ERTP will change voter registration by making it individual (no longer done by the ‘head of the household’), creating a new digital channel and confirming identities before accepting registrations. There will be a large set-up cost: ERTP is being done for policy reasons (to ensure elections are fair), not to save money. If ERTP produces a higher quality voter register, it may ultimately help abolish the annual “canvass” (which confirms the voter list every year): this would be a large saving, but no decision has been taken.</p>
