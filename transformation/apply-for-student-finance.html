  <h2>Successes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>More than 800,000 digital applications for full-time students (academic year 2014 / 2015) were made using the live service between January and July 2014</li>
    <li>Service delivery team awarded TechExcel Best Agile Project at the <a href="http://www.softwaretestingawards.com/2013-awards/2013-winners/">European Testing Awards</a></li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Challenges</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Incorporating service manager roles within the organisation’s transformation programme</li>
    <li>Current hosting won’t meet the future needs of the service, and upgrading is taking longer than expected</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Next</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Rebuild the core service based on user feedback to include additional products</li>
    <li>Continuously improve the applications to achieve even higher levels of completion and user satisfaction</li>
    <li>Create a performance platform dashboard for public-facing real-time information about the service</li>
  </ul>
