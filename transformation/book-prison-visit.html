    <h2 id="benefits">Benefits for users</h2>

    <p>If you want to visit someone in prison you will be able to book using an online service without waiting to speak to prison staff</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 id="business-case">Business case</h2>

    <p>Different prisons book visits in different ways. It is mostly done by phone or email and often requires family members to spend a long time getting through on the phone. A digital channel will cut administrative costs to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and make the process easier for families, encouraging more to visit.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Up to £2m saving from staff reduction in the medium term</li>
      <li>Easier to change visit times, hence more visits and better opportunity for rehabilitation</li>
      <li>Redeploy prison service staff to higher value non-administrative activity</li>
    </ul>
