    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
      … making registering to act as an agent easier and quicker… agents will have the tools to take more control of their clients’ tax affairs and undertake transactions for them with minimal involvement from HMRC… any new IT services developed for individual customers should be available to agents.
    </blockquote>

  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>This service will provide a new service for tax agents to work with HMRC online. It will allow agents to see information about their clients and to take control of a range of transactions on their behalf. These will be built on a new digital tax platform which will over time replace the current HMRC Portal and be the default platform for new user-facing services.</p>
