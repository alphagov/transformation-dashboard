  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>Personal Independence Payment (PIP) was introduced in April 2013 for people aged 16 to 64 to help with the extra costs of long-term ill-health or disability. Users can make a claim over the telephone or through the post and may need to attend a face-to-face consultation with a health professional to assess how much support they need.</p>

  <p>We’re now building an in-depth understanding of user needs to see which parts of the PIP process might best be delivered through digital channels.</p>
