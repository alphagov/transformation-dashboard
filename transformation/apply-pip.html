     …an opportunity to work with disability organisations to redesign business processes and facilitate a move to digital… working closely with GDS to develop an online service, learning the lessons from a controlled launch, with the intention of bringing this in as soon as possible after the launch of PIP.

    <h2 id="business-case">Business case</h2>

    <p>Personal Independence Payment was introduced in April 2013 for people aged 16 to 64 to help with the extra costs of long-term ill-health or disability. Users can make a claim over the telephone or through the post and may need to attend a face-to-face consultation with a health professional to assess how much support they need.</p>

    <p>We’re now building an in-depth understanding of user needs to see which parts of the PIP process might best be delivered through digital channels.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Give deaf claimants a better channel (currently by phone)</li>
      <li>Provide clarity and confidence on likely outcome to potential claimants at the start</li>
      <li>Reduce unsuccessful claims – currently 50% on Disability Living Allowance </li>
      <li>Online take-up will reduce costs of running the existing telephony channel</li>
      <li>Higher data quality will cut the number of expensive face-to-face consultations</li>
      <li>Greater clarity and quality of service will reduce the number of expensive appeals</li>
    </ul>
