    <p>Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) allows people to appoint family or friends to take decisions for them if they become unable to do so. There are 2 types of LPA (legal and medical). The present system is paper based and hugely inefficient. The transformation aims to put it online for the first time, cut costs and improve speed and accuracy. Government policy is to increase greatly the number of LPAs (by making them easier and cheaper to obtain) – this means that citizens’ wishes will be known in advance of the type of unfortunate accident that can happen to anyone at any time, and mean there are fewer expensive applications to the Court of Protection which can decide how incapacitated citizens’ affairs are handled.</p>
