    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>

  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>Lasting power of attorney (LPA) allows people to appoint  a person or persons to take decisions for them if they lose mental capacity. There are 2 types of LPA - property &amp; finance, and health &amp; welfare. The present system is paper based and inefficient. The transformation aims to put it online for the first time, cut costs and improve speed and accuracy.</p>

  <p>OPG's aim is to encourage more people to plan ahead for an uncertain future by making LPAs easier and quicker to create thus allowing citizens to choose for themselves who they would want to be making decisions on their behalf were they to lose capacity. This could also potentially mean fewer expensive applications to the Court of Protection, who would need to step in and appoint someone to manage a person's affairs if they hadn't put an LPA in place.</p>
