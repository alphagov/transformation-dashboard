    <blockquote>
      Currently the process for transferring or retaining a car number plate and related services is a paper transaction, often carried out at a DVLA local Office. This process will be digitised so the customer or an intermediary can do it online.

    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>&gt;18m transactions per year relate to the ownership and status of vehicles (e.g. death of owner, purchase / destruction / export of car). A further 1.6m transactions related to personalised registration (e.g. buying the number plate, transferring it to another car, etc.). The exemplar was scoped as all large vehicle transactions except those affected by abolishing the tax disc and those already highly digitised. Discovery revealed that easily digitisable activity falls into 3 domains – vehicle ownership / status, personalised registration and data sharing – all 3 depend on good vehicle records.</p>
