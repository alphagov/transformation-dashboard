    <blockquote>
      Improving our web-based guidance and digital communications to ensure they are tailored and interactive, including the ability for customers to report changes digitally. Eliminating outbound paper communications for those customers who are already dealing with us online. Expanding the SA offering to those customers who do not currently file online. Extending the current digital service to include increasing the number of payments we make digitally.

    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>The tax exemplars will provide digital PAYE services for people in employment (benefits in kind), a fully digital self assessment service, improved tools and tax dashboard for small businesses, and a new system for tax agents to use online services. These will be built on a new “digital tax platform” which will over time replace the current HMRC Portal and be the default platform for new customer-facing services. The new tax platform will be fully integrated with the pan-government ID Assurance programme and with GOV.UK.</p>
