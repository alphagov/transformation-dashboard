    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>When an employer becomes insolvent employees are often owed money (especially for redundancy pay). The Redundancy Payments Service processes these claims, which are paid from the National Insurance Fund (NIF). The present system is entirely paper based - this leads to unnecessary cost and fraud potential as well as delays and confusion for vulnerable users. We are not able to predict benefits accurately, but the current transactional spend makes us confidently expect multi-million pound annual benefits, leading to a substantial (though currently undetermined) positive ROI.</p>
