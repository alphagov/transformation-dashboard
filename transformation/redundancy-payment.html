      Employees who are facing the challenge of redundancy will be able to apply for and access financial support from Government in a more immediate and easy to navigate manner than current channels allow, as will the insolvency practitioners administering cases.

    <h2 id="scope">Scope of exemplar</h2>

    <p>When an employer becomes insolvent employees are often owed money (especially for redundancy pay). The Redundancy Payments Service processes  claims for statutory redundancy payments, which are paid from the National Insurance Fund (NIF). The present system is entirely paper based - this leads to unnecessary cost as well as delays.  We are not able to predict benefits accurately at this discovery stage, but the current transactional spend makes us confidently expect improved customer service and significant annual benefits, leading to a substantial (though currently undetermined) positive ROI.</p>
