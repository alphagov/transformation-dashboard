    <blockquote>
      Employees who are facing the challenge of redundancy will be able to apply for and access financial support from Government in a more immediate and easy to navigate manner than current channels allow, as will the insolvency practitioners administering cases.

    <p>If your company has recently become insolvent you will be able to apply for redundancy payment online</p>

    <h2 id="business-case">Business case</h2>

    <p>When an employer becomes insolvent employees are often owed money (especially for redundancy pay). The Redundancy Payments Service processes these claims, which are paid from the National Insurance Fund (NIF). The present system is entirely paper based - this leads to unnecessary cost and fraud potential as well as delays and confusion for vulnerable users. We are not able to predict benefits accurately, but the current transactional spend makes us confidently expect multi-million pound annual benefits, leading to a substantial (though currently undetermined) positive ROI.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>faster, more convenient payments for financially distressed users</li>
      <li>lower fiscal costs: significant proportion of £9.2m annual administration cost</li>
      <li>easier for insolvency practitioners leading to downward pressure on fees</li>
      <li>less fraud</li>
      <li>less phone contact</li>
    </ul>
