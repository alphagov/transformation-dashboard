  <h2>Successes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Funding has been secured for the next stage of development</li>
    <li>End-to-end user experience in place</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Challenges</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Integrating with existing systems remains a challenge, as does balancing the time spent on this with the time required to develop the user journey</li>
    <li>Integrating <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/category/id-assurance/">identity assurance</a> into our service when there is no record of who applicants might be</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Next</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Build identity assurance into the service</li>
    <li>Continue research and development of the service</li>
    <li>Revisit how to integrate new service with existing systems</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Employees who are facing the challenge of redundancy will be able to apply for and access financial support from Government in a more immediate and easy to navigate manner than current channels allow, as will the insolvency practitioners administering cases.
    </blockquote>

  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>When an employer becomes insolvent employees are often owed money (especially for redundancy pay). The Redundancy Payments Service processes claims for statutory redundancy payments, which are paid from the National Insurance Fund (NIF). The current claim process is largely paper based, which leads to unnecessary cost and increased potential for errors and delays. The scope of the exemplar is to create a digital claim process that will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>reduce the handling of paper</li>
    <li>identify potential problems within claims so that they may be resolved more quickly</li>
    <li>increase confidence and trust in the system for both claimants and insolvency practitioners</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Digital inclusion</h2>

  <p>GDS has mapped the exemplars against the <a href="/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion">digital inclusion scale</a> to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. <a href="/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#redundancy-payments">See the rating for Redundancy payments</a>.</p>
