    <h2 id="business-case">Business case</h2>

    <p>The Property Register will provide a self service facility to enquire whether land / property is registered, if it is a freehold or leasehold registration, and the title number including copies of the register and title plan for England and Wales. This new service will be free and replace a paper-based fee-paying route - it is largely aimed at business users (e.g. property surveyors).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Operational cost reduction of £2.2m / year, realised as £1.5m fee reduction for customers and additional £700k saving to Land Registry</li>
      <li>Deflecting enquiries away from a loss making service</li>
      <li>Reducing handling of paper forms within the department</li>
      <li>Public can self-serve: putting downward pressure on surveyor costs</li>
      <li>Help plan future digital transformation and embed agile culture</li>
    </ul>
