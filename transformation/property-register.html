    <h2>Digital strategy statement</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Home buyers and business intermediaries will be able to search for, gain data on and register property in the UK, without the need for the delays inherent in current disjointed, paper based systems.
    </blockquote>

    <p>From the '<cite><a href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/digitalstrategy/page/7/">Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills digital strategy</a></cite>' â€“ December 2012</p>

  <h2>Scope of exemplar</h2>

  <p>The property register will provide a self-service facility to enquire whether land or property is registered, if it is a freehold or leasehold registration, and the title number including copies of the register and title plan for England and Wales. This new service will be free and replace a paper-based fee-paying route - it is largely aimed at business users (eg property surveyors).</p>
