homepage-intro: |
    If you want to transfer ownership of a car you’ll be able to do it yourself online or using an intermediary

detail-page-intro: |
    18 million vehicle owner transfers each year by businesses and citizens


digital-strategy-statement: |
    Currently when a customer sells or disposes of a vehicle, the log book needs to be posted to DVLA to be updated. We will digitise this process so it can be carried out self-service or through an intermediary.

scope-of-exemplar: |
    More than 18 million transactions per year relate to the ownership and status of vehicles (eg death of owner, purchase / destruction / export of car). A further 1.6m transactions related to personalised registration (eg buying the number plate, transferring it to another car, etc). The exemplar was scoped as all large vehicle transactions except those affected by abolishing the tax disc and those already highly digitised. Discovery revealed that easily digitisable activity falls into 3 domains – vehicle ownership / status, personalised registration and data sharing – all 3 depend on good vehicle records.
