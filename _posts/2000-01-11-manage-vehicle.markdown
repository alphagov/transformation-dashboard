    Currently when a customer sells or disposes of a vehicle, the log book needs to be posted to DVLA to be updated. We will digitise this process so it can be carried out self-service or through an intermediary.

scope-of-exemplar: |
    More than 18 million transactions per year relate to maintaining accurate records of vehicles, their keepers, and personalised registrations.  These include disposal to trade, acquisition from trade, notification of change or death of a keeper, retention of a registration mark, and assigning a registration mark.  The Vehicle Management and Personalised Registration exemplars will deliver fully digital services for these transactions, and improve the quality and accuracy of data for DVLA and its external stakeholders.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See rating for Vehicle management](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#vehicle-management).
