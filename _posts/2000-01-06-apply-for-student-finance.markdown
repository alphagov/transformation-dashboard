successes: |

  - Service delivery team awarded TechExcel Best Agile Project at the [European Testing Awards](http://www.softwaretestingawards.com/2013-awards/2013-winners/)

challenges: |
  - Incorporating service manager roles within the organisation’s transformation programme
  - Current hosting won’t meet the future needs of the service, and upgrading is taking longer than expected
  
next-steps: |
  - Rebuild the core service based on user feedback to include additional products
  - Continuously improve the applications to achieve even higher levels of completion and user satisfaction
  - Create a performance platform dashboard for public-facing real-time information about the service
