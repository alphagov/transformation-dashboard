scope-of-exemplar: |
  The new digital self-assessment exemplar service will allow users to opt out of receiving paper statements and receive digital alerts instead. Like all the HMRC exemplar services, it will be built on the new digital tax platform. The aim is for this exemplar service to save HMRC £800,000 this year by:
  - persuading 1.3 million customers to opt into the service
  - putting an end to 2.5 million letters
  - reducing the number of phone calls placed by 63,000

  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for Digital self-assessment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#digital-self-assessment-and-your-tax-account).
