scope-of-exemplar: |
    This service will provide digital PAYE services for people in employment (benefits in kind). The initial release will allow people to report changes to their company car tax. This service will be built on a new ‘digital tax platform’ and, for the first time, deliver digital services for PAYE customers which will eventually replace the current HMRC Portal and be the default platform for new user-facing services. The new tax platform will be fully integrated with new identity assurance service.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for PAYE for employees](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#paye-for-employees).
