  Every customer in the UK will have their own personalised digital tax account, so we can help make it simpler, quicker and easier to pay the right tax at the right time. Four services (PAYE for Employees, Digital Self-Assessment, Your Tax Account and Agent Online Self-service) will deliver stand-alone, end-to-end services through digital channels...PAYE for Employees will make it easier for customers to tell us about changes that affect their tax code.

scope-of-exemplar: |
  This service will provide digital PAYE services for people in employment (benefits in kind). The initial release will allow people to report changes to their company car tax. This service will be built on a new ‘digital tax platform’ and, for the first time, deliver digital services for PAYE customers which will eventually replace the current HMRC Portal and be the default platform for new user-facing services. The new tax platform will be fully integrated with new identity assurance service.

  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use.
