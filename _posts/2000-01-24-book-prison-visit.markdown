digital-strategy-statement: |
    ...our single biggest transactional service, which at the moment is a phone- or email-based, manual data entry system.

scope-of-exemplar: |
    Different prisons book visits in different ways. It is mostly done by phone or email and often requires family members to spend a long time getting through on the phone. A digital channel will cut administrative costs to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and make the process easier for families --- encouraging more to visit --- and more efficient for professional visitors.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use.
