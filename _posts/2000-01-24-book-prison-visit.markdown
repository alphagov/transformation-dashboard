homepage-intro: |
    If you're visiting a prison you’ll be able to book using a single, national service, reducing staff time and offering a better experience for families, friends and professionals

detail-page-intro: |
    1.5 million prison visits booked online every year


digital-strategy-statement: |
    ...our single biggest transactional service, which at the moment is a phone- or email-based, manual data entry system.

    From the '[Ministry of Justice digital strategy](http://open.justice.gov.uk/digital-strategy/)' – December 2012
    

scope-of-exemplar: |
    Different prisons book visits in different ways. It is mostly done by phone or email and often requires family members to spend a long time getting through on the phone. A digital channel will cut administrative costs to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and make the process easier for families --- encouraging more to visit --- and more efficient for professional visitors.
