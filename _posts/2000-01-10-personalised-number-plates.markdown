digital-strategy-statement: |
    Currently the process for transferring or retaining a car number plate and related services is a paper transaction, often carried out at a DVLA local Office. This process will be digitised so the customer or an intermediary can do it online.

scope-of-exemplar: |
    More than 18 million transactions per year relate to maintaining accurate records of vehicles, their keepers, and personalised registrations.  These include disposal to trade, acquisition from trade, notification of change or death of a keeper, retention of a registration mark, and assigning a registration mark.  The Vehicle Management and Personalised Registration exemplars will deliver fully digital services for these transactions, and improve the quality and accuracy of data for DVLA and its external stakeholders.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for Personalised registrations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#personalised-registrations).
