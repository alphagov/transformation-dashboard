scope-of-exemplar: |
    More than 18 million transactions per year relate to maintaining accurate records of vehicles, their keepers, and personalised registrations.  These include disposal to trade, acquisition from trade, notification of change or death of a keeper, retention of a registration mark, and assigning a registration mark.  The Vehicle Management and Personalised Registration exemplars will deliver fully digital services for these transactions, and improve the quality and accuracy of data for DVLA and its external stakeholders.
