scope-of-exemplar: |
    The new service will enable easy online registration as a waste carrier. Savings currently forecast at between £2 million and £4 million, to be achieved over the next five years.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for Waste carrier registration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#waste-carrier-registration).
