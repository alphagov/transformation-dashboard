status: "public-beta"
status-strapline: "In public beta. The team has built a minimum viable product for the case working system, which has passed accreditation. Though anyone can check their eligibility to use the service, sign-up is currently limited through the issuing of invitation codes by airlines and Border Force officers, so that the service can be rolled out gradually."

digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use.
