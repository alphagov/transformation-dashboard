scope-of-exemplar: |
    The exemplar focuses on patent renewals, which is the highest volume transaction and the one most regularly demanded by the Intellectual Property Office's users. Patent renewals is a pathfinder for a digital service that manages the lifecycle of an intellectual property right, from application to grant to renewal. The Intellectual Property Office has been using agile development for 2+ years and is currently considering a genuine agile business transformation programme to fully align its digital services with the improved business process.
