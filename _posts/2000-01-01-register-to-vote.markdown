homepage-intro: |
    A digital service to make registering to vote simpler, clearer and faster for individuals

detail-page-intro: |
    5 million people registering online to vote each year. Moving 46 million voters from household to individual registration


digital-strategy-statement: |
    [We will] increase public trust in the electoral system by improving the accuracy and security of the register...

    From the '[Cabinet Office digital strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-digital-strategy)' --- December 2012
    

scope-of-exemplar: |
    The Electoral Registration Transformation Programme will change the electoral registration process by introducing Individual Electoral Registration (IER). Instead of one person in a household supplying the details of all people living at the same address (which can result in fraud and errors), IER will require people to register individually.
    
    To support IER and make it simpler for users, a new digital channel will be created and a method of confirming identities will be introduced. IER is intended to increase trust and modernise our electoral system.
