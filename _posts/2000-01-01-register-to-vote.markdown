digital-strategy-statement: |
    [We will] increase public trust in the electoral system by improving the accuracy and security of the register...

digital-strategy-source: |
    From the '[Cabinet Office digital strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-digital-strategy)' --- December 2012
    

scope-of-exemplar: |
    The Electoral Registration Transformation Programme will improve the electoral registration process by introducing Individual Electoral Registration (IER). Instead of one person in a household supplying the details of all people living at the same address (which can result in fraud and errors), IER will require people to register individually.
    
    To support IER and make it simpler for users, a new digital channel will be created and a method of confirming identities will be introduced. IER is intended to increase trust and modernise our electoral system.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for Electoral registration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#electoral-registration).
