digital-strategy-statement: |
    A new enquiry service to provide motor insurance industry and driver enquiry services, all delivered through a ‘greenfield’ IT procurement approach developed jointly with the GDS. This will see a move away from expensive legacy ICT systems, using an innovative ‘agile’ approach to designing services and platforms.

scope-of-exemplar: |
    Motor insurers will access DVLA data on penalty points and what vehicles users are allowed to drive to check insurance applications and cut honest drivers’ premiums, thus implementing Financial Services Authority requirements. Drivers will be able to check their personal data through a portal.
    
    Phase 2: Possible data access for car hire companies, police and other European governments.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for View driving record](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#view-driving-record).
