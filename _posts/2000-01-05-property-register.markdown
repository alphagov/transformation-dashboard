scope-of-exemplar: |
    The property register will provide a self-service facility to enquire whether land or property is registered, if it is a freehold or leasehold registration, and the title number including copies of the register and title plan for England and Wales. This new service will be free and replace a paper-based fee-paying route - it is largely aimed at business users (eg property surveyors).
