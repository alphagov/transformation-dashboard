scope-of-exemplar: |
    In line with new MOJ policy, employment tribunals started charging fees from 29 July. The technology to implement this ministerial priority includes a payment mechanism, which is being improved through digital input on user testing and the Digital by Default Service Standard. Phase 2 runs from July to December and will improve the flexibility of the service, its reporting, and its ability to support user errors around manual transactions. Phase 3 is currently being scoped.
