scope-of-exemplar: |
    When an employer becomes insolvent employees are often owed money (especially for redundancy pay). The Redundancy Payments Service processes claims for statutory redundancy payments, which are paid from the National Insurance Fund (NIF). The current claim process is largely paper based, which leads to unnecessary cost and increased potential for errors and delays. The scope of the exemplar is to create a digital claim process that will:

    - reduce the handling of paper
    - identify potential problems within claims so that they may be resolved more quickly
    - increase confidence and trust in the system for both claimants and insolvency practitioners

successes: |
  - The user journey for notice claim applications has been built ready for private beta release
  - End-to-end backend integration has been delivered
  - Hosting for the digital service is in place
  
challenges: |
  - Ensuring we have the right team in place to deliver a beta service before the end of 2014
  - Lack of engagement from senior management
  - Integrating [identity assurance](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/category/id-assurance/) into our service when there is no record of who applicants might be

next-steps: |
  - Building identity assurance into the service   
  - Continue research and development of the service
  - Work on how assisted digital can provide support for people using the service
