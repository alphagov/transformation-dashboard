homepage-intro: |
    If you want to advertise or apply for an apprenticeship you’ll be able to do it quickly and easily online

detail-page-intro: |
    1.38 million online apprenticeships applications every year


digital-strategy-statement: |
    All customer journeys across information and transactions will be integrated so individuals can find information tailored to their needs and search, view and apply for opportunities online in an engaging and inspiring way. Employers will be able to quickly and easily self-serve to engage with apprenticeships and advertise vacancies and identify suitable candidates.

scope-of-exemplar: |
    The National Apprenticeship Service (NAS) funds and supports apprenticeships throughout England. The existing digital service allows employers to advertise vacancies with potential apprentices searching and applying online. But user experience is poor (especially on search), so that the way applicants are matched to potential vacancies is suboptimal and both applicants and employers are put off using it. Addressing this would bring real economic benefit. The National Audit Office (NAO) reports that the current £500 million apprenticeship spend is more than worthwhile for boosting the economy. For each 1% by which better digital tools increase the value of the service, the NAO report implies we should expect well over £5m per year of economic boost, thus even on very conservative assumptions, the exemplar will easily have a positive return on investment in terms of economic growth and tax revenues.

successes: |
  - Passed alpha to beta [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) assessment
  
challenges: |
  - The Skills Funding Agency restructure is creating challenges; responsibilities are changing frequently, meaning the project team is sometimes unclear on how issues will be resolved
  - A potential code freeze on the legacy service may affect iterative development of the new service 
  
next-steps: |
  - Continue beta development 
  - Clarify the minimum viable service to be developed and create a schedule for that work
