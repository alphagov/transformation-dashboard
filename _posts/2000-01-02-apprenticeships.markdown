successes: |
  - Passed alpha to beta [Digital by Default Service Standard](/service-manual/digital-by-default) assessment
  - The scope of the public beta of the candidate service has been defined
  - Several permanent digital delivery team members have been appointed and are being introduced into the exemplar team 
  
challenges: |
  - The scope of the service to be delivered for candidates, employers and training providers is ambitious and not all service functionality will be delivered before programme end
  - The public beta of the candidate service is dependent on changes to the legacy system API managed by a third party supplier
  
next-steps: |
  - Complete development of features for the public beta of the candidate service 
  - Test that changes to the legacy service work as intended
  - Continue selection and appointment of permanent digital delivery team members

  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use.
