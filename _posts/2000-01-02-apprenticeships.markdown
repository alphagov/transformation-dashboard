  To create an easy to use digital service where apprenticeships can be advertised and applied for, with the transaction supported by clear information to inform and advise users, so that they can self-serve, leading to minimal additional support being required.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for Apprenticeship applications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#apprenticeship-applications).
