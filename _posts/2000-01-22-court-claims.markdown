scope-of-exemplar: |
  Civil claims are a way for the public to solve civil legal disputes or obtain money or property owed. The exemplar will create a digital service initially for accelerated possession claims, to improve the user experience and the efficiency of the service.


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for Civil claims](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#civil-claims).
