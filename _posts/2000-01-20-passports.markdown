scope-of-exemplar: |
    The existing passport service within the UK allows you to complete an online application form to apply for, renew or update a passport. The user then prints a declaration form, signs and dates it and sends it for processing with any documents or photographs that are needed.

    Her Majesty’s Passport Services is exploring with GDS the scope for a fully digital passport service for UK adult renewals.

  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use.
