homepage-intro: |
    You’ll be able to submit accurate and verifiable information online about how you use your land, so you can claim subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy

detail-page-intro: |
    105,000 rural support transactions every year


digital-strategy-statement: |
    ...a fundamental end-to-end redesign of the whole process, introducing a single IT solution with digital delivery as a core design principle.
    
digital-strategy-source: |
    From the '[Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs digital strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defra-digital-strategy-2012)' --- December 2012
    

scope-of-exemplar: |
    A new digital service to implement the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in England.
    
    The new service will bring together systems and processes currently managed by four organisations; Defra, Rural Payments Agency, Forestry Commission and Natural England.
    
    This simple and effective system will make it easy for users to understand and apply for CAP payments. It will help prevent fines (‘disallowance’) for making payments that don’t comply with CAP rules (~£600m since 2005 ).
