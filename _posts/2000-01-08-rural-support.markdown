scope-of-exemplar: |
    A new digital service to implement the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in England.
    
    The new service will bring together systems and processes currently managed by four organisations; Defra, Rural Payments Agency, Forestry Commission and Natural England.
    
    This simple and effective system will make it easy for users to understand and apply for CAP payments. It will help prevent fines (‘disallowance’) for making payments that don’t comply with CAP rules (~£600m since 2005 ).


digital-inclusion: |
  GDS has mapped the exemplars against the [digital inclusion scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#measuring-digital-exclusion) to help show where these services may be difficult for some people to use. [See the rating for Rural payments](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/exemplar-services-and-identity-assurance-how-complex-they-are#rural-support-common-agricultural-policy).
